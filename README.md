# Computer Vision Toolkit: Transforming Visual Data into Intelligence 👁️🚀

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Toolkit**. This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects and implementations developed during my journey through the **Master School** Computer Vision curriculum.

## 🎓 Curriculum Attribution
The content and structured learning path in this repository are based on the **Master School** Computer Vision program. It reflects a rigorous transition from classical image processing to advanced neural network architectures.

## 🛠️ Roadmap & Core Modules

### 1️⃣ Foundations of Visual Perception
* **Digital Image Processing:** Understanding how machines "see" through pixels and channels.
* **Toolbox:** Practical manipulation and feature extraction using **Python** and **OpenCV**.

### 2️⃣ Deep Learning & Image Classification
* **Neural Networks from Scratch:** Constructing and training custom architectures.
* **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG, etc.).

### 3️⃣ Advanced Computer Vision Tasks
* **Object Detection:** Implementing models that locate multiple objects within a frame (e.g., YOLO).
* **Semantic Segmentation:** Pixel-level classification using U-Net architectures.

## ☁️ Zero-Setup: Run Directly on GitHub
* **GitHub Codespaces:** Launch a full-featured VS Code environment in your browser.
* **Google Colab:** Look for the "Open in Colab" badges within folders to run models on free cloud GPUs.
